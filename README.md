# Brings Search to Podcasts through Automatic Transcription

## Why?
* With all the amazing work podcasters are publishing each day, there’s no good reason why audio isn’t a first-class citizen in the same way.
* Increased discoverability can help attract new audiences and make it easier for former listeners to find the program again.

## Features
* Automatically discover, compose (transcript & metadata) and index podcasts.
* Podcast search API
* Backend status API
* Find more podcasts like this.
* Embedded players
* Lazy loading images
* Card shadow on hover
