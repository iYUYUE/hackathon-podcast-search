# Brings Search to Podcasts through Automatic Transcription

## Why?
* With all the amazing work podcasters are publishing each day, there’s no good reason why audio isn’t a first-class citizen in the same way.
* Increased discoverability can help attract new audiences and make it easier for former listeners to find the program again.
